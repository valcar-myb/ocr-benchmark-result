# Detection
```bash
python3 train_pytorch.py \
    /path/to/TextDetection_train \
    /path/to/TextDetection_val \
    db_resnet50 \
    --epochs 50 \
    --workers 32 \
    --pretrained \
    --freze-backbone \
    --wd 0.00001 \
    -b 8
```

# Recognition
```bash
python3 train_pytorch.py \
    crnn_vgg16_bn \
    --train_path /path/to/TextRecognition_train \
    --val_path /path/to/TextRecognition_val \
    --epochs 50 \
    --vocab sroie
```
The sroie dataset has some character that are not in the default vocab of doctr, to solve it just add this line of code in `/doctr/doctr/datasets/vocabs.py`:
```python
VOCABS["sroie"] = VOCABS["french"] + " Â·"
```
