    "m06-042.png": "When you come here, when you come to the True World, you become a true human. The grub of the tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes. So humans change. 'I cannot know what he says,' Maris said stubbornly, throwing himself down. But Lily-yo and Flor were listening.",
    "m06-048.png": "To His True World, as you call it, we come to die,'\n\nLily-yo said, doubtingly. The Captive with the\n\nfleshless jew said, 'The grub of the tigerfly thinks\n\nit dies when it changes into a tigerfly.' 'You are still\n\nyoung,' said the Chief Captive. 'You begin newly here.\n\nWhere are your souls?' Lily-yo and Tla looked at\n\neach other. In their flight from the twilight they had\n\nheedlessly thrown down their souls.",
    "m06-056.png": "Hari's had trampled on his. It was unthinkable!\n\n'You see. You needed them no more. You are still young. You may be able to have babies. Some of those babies may be born with wings.' The Captive with the boneless arms added, 'Some may be born wrong, as we are. Some may be born right.'",
    "m06-067.png": "'You are too foul to live!' Haris growled. 'Why are you not killed?' 'Because we know all things,' The Chief Captive said. Suddenly his second head roused itself and declared, 'To be a good shape is not all in life. To know is also good. Because we cannot move well we can - think. This tribe of the True World is good and knows these things.",
    "m06-076.png": "So it lets us rule it.' Flor and Lily-yo\nmuttered together. 'Do you say that you poor\nCaptives rule the True World?' Lily-yo asked\nat last. 'We do.' 'Then why are you captives?'\n\nThe flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected,\nmaking his perpetual little gesture of protest,\nspoke for the first time.",
    "m06-083.png": "To rule is to serve, woman. Those who bear power are slaves to it. Only an outcast is free. Because we are captives, we have the time to talk and think and plan and know. Those who know command the knives of others. 'No hurt will come to you, Lily-yo,' Band Appa Bondi added. 'You will live among us and enjoy your life free from harm.'",
    "m06-091.png": "'No!' The Chief Captive said with both mouths.\n'Before she can enjoy, Lily-yo and her companion\nFlor -this other man creature is plainly useless -\nmust help our great plan.' 'The invasion?' Bondi\nasked. 'What else? Flor and Lily-yo, you arrive\nhere at good time. Memories of the Heavy World\nand its savage life are still fresh in you.",
    "m06-098.png": "We need such memories. So we ask you to go back there on a great plan we have. 'Go back!' gasped Flor. 'Yes. We plan to attack The Heavy World. You must help to lead our force.' The long afternoon of eternity wore on, that long golden road of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to everlasting night.",
    "m06-106.png": "Motion there was, but motion without event - except for those negligible event that seemed so large to the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor and Haris there were many events. Chief of these was that they learned to fly properly. The pains associated with their wings soon died away as the wonderful new flesh and tendon strengthened. To sail up in the light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly flopping movement of flymen on the Heavy World had no place here.",
    "n01-000.png": "Alistair was a bachelor. All his life he had been inclined to regard women as something which must necessarily be subordinated to his career. Now he realised that he was entrusting not only his own life, but Geoffrey's as well, to a strange girl whom he had never met and on whom after no more than a couple of telephone calls he was prepared to place complete reliance.",
    "n01-004.png": "It was a novel experience. Alastair was quite unable to explain why he should feel so much confidence in her. Once again she checked back her intuitions. It was obvious that he did not fail to appreciate the faith which he was placing in her and was prepared to accept the responsibility.",
    "n01-009.png": "Good luck, Sir Maurice,\" she said quietly. \"I'll be waiting for you at the Hotel Ronda at six this evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you both at midnight. They might have been arranging a supper party. Then one song of.

    "n01-020.png": "For some reason the orderlies had forgotten to switch on the lights; there were no colour-\nphysical features were distinguishable solely by gradients of silvery greyness. Even the snow-\ncapped summit of Mont Blanc, seven miles below, was not recognisable among the host of lower peaks. The screen of the air-to-air radar glowed, occasionally minute spots flickered across its surface, but there were no permanent image.",
    "n01-031.png": "In the exceptional clarity he was even able to make a direct comparison between the radar image and the ground itself. Ahead lay the Plain of Lombardy; to the right, Turin; to the left, Milan. The directional angle of the scanner could be adjusted to cover any particular area within its range. Geoffrey turned the scale slowly \u2621 to cover the ground immediately ahead.",
    "n01-036.png": "He was able to pick out towns, unrecognisable to the naked eye, obscured by the ground haze which even on the clearest night limited angular vision. He glanced at the speed recorder. It seemed almost incredible that the tiny white figure of P.S against which the needle was resting could really mean hundred of knots.",
    "n01-045.png": "Now, as Hoastin reduced the throost, the pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft dipped slightly. The needle of the speed recorder swung gently through 8.0, 7.0, 6.0 before coming to rest at 5.0, \"We're a bit ahead of time,\" said Hoastin, \"we'll run in on minimum engine power.\" Geoffrey smiled. Hoastin talked of running in when they were still more than four hundred miles from their destination.",
    "n01-052.png": "They were nearing Modena. Geoffrey focused the radar scanner on the bridge over the Po, barely forty miles to port. He was able to trace the course of the river; he thought he could recognize the trunk of N12 along which he had motored so desperately little more than twenty-four hours earlier. Since then he had flown to England, attended the vital conference in Bruce Denton's office, been whisked by special helicopter from the Horse Guards Parade to Boscombe Down, slept for six blessed refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds of the journey back to the place where every indication pointed to Eve being held.",
    "n01-057.png": "Geoffrey set himself to consider the movements of the Bentley. It had passed him at the temporary bridge over the Tastaro at a few minutes past ten on the previous night. He worked out the distance on the presumption that its route had been through Florence and Rome and then across Italy via Forl\u00ec to Ravenna. It came to just over six hundred miles.",
    "n02-000.png": "DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the\ntime they docked at Rellery. And though Guy,\nmade nervous by Beryl's silence, drove at reckless\nspeed to the villa, it was quickly evident that\nthe party was over. Pies came strolling out to\nmeet the Deaves, and as soon as Guy had\ndriven away, invited them casually to come to\nhis flat for a drink.",
    "n02-004.png": "To Beryl, at least, this was anti-climax with a \nvengeance. She had expected to be met with violent \nreproaches - and here he was bland and smiling.\nBut it did not take her long to realise that his mood\nwas less pleasant than appeared on the surface.\nHe told her nonchalantly, as he led the way to his\nown veranda, that he had taken the liberty of\nasking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -\nto come over and make the presentation in his stead.",
    "n02-009.png": "\"I caught him just as he was going to the airport to meet Blanche,\" he said. \"As a matter of fact I'd asked him last night to deputise for me and fetch her. He brought her to the party too. They're both here.\" \"I didn't know she was coming back from Barbados so soon.\" Beryl said the first thing that came into her head.",
    "n02-016.png": "\"Oh, she was due.\" And then he added in the same\ncasual tone, \"She's not returning to her family. She's\ngoing to live with friends of the bank manager, just\nthis side of Relleray.\" Mrs. Duane made a suitable\ncomment, but Beryl said nothing. She was trying\nto sort things out in her mind. That beneath his\nunnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering \nwith anger against Leslie had no doubt.",
    "n02-028.png": "Isabel and Blanche were quick to sympathise and to\nexpress their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment\nof his guest. But Piers remained aloof, and when Beryl\nsuggested having a second party, the following week, he\npoured cold water on the project. Everyone, he declared,\nhad had a thoroughly good time, and it would take them\nnearly to next week to settle down again. Meanwhile\ntheft would have betaken himself and his well-\nearned gratuity to his native village at the\nnorth of the island.",
    "n02-033.png": "It was all over and done with.\nFor the time being she was content to let\nit go at that, but she resolved to have\nit out with Piers when a reasonable\nopportunity presented itself. He must\nlearn that he could not treat her\nwith injustice and contempt; ignoring\nher explanations as though he were\na schoolmaster and she a small,\nignorant child.",
    "n02-037.png": "He gave her no chance of any private conversation that evening, for when Blandes and Jack left, he went with them. But next morning she insisted on his taking her out in the jeep - to find, if possible, the best and his relations, and that tell them of her great disappointment at being held up in Baliron.",
    "n02-040.png": "With an air of resignation he sent Judy, his Boxer, to the back, and made room for her beside him. \"Is that all you want to do?\" he asked, letting in the clutch. \"No; I want to make you understand just what happened about this Balcom trip,\" she returned coldly. \"I'm a little tired of being treated like an ineffective imbecile.\"",
    "n02-045.png": "and I'm heartily sick of being constantly called to account for my manners,\" he retorted. \"What have I done wrong now? I cover up for you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack to make the presentation, I run the damned party to the best of my ability - saying the sugary things you ought to have been there to say - and all you can do is to find it fault.\"",
    "n02-049.png": "It's your superior attitude that riles me.\" Beryl was scarlet with annoyance. \"That I happened to be marrooned at Falcon doesn't interest you in the faintest degree. You look as though it was only what you expected of me, as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert and his pals down.",
    "n02-054.png": "As your employee it's not my business to understand all the whys and wherefores of your actions,\" he said stiffly. \"Still less to criticise you.\"\n\"Oh, drop that nonsense, Piers. Be yourself,\" she exclaimed, with mounting exasperation. \"Very well.\" He brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough path fringed and shaded by citrus trees. \"If you want my true opinion I'll give it.",
    "n02-062.png": "You made some sort of a protest to Graybury.\nI'll give you credit for that. But you didn't press\nthe matter because, very naturally, you were\nthoroughly enjoying Forest's company in\nidyllic surroundings. \"How dare you say\nsuch a thing?\" she blazed. \"For goodness'\nsake show a glimmer of reason,\" was his\nequally indignant rejoinder.",
    "n02-082a.png": "\"You talk as though we were alone on Balicoa!\"\nShe avoided his gaze, and tried to ignore that\nlast impertinent remark. \"With four other people -\"\n\"When you were once used to circumvent.\"\nThe mockery in his voice had deepened. \"With\nall due deference, Miss Deane - come off it!\"\nShe met his eyes then.",
    "n02-098.png": "She wavered, and at last said too slowly, \"If you must drag the truth out of me, I must ask you to regard it as confidential.\" \"My dear Beryl, don't tell me anything if you'd rather not.\" He was clearly startled by her words. \"But remember, it was you, not I, who started this conversation.\"",
    "n02-151.png": "Their air of smiling somnolence showed them to have been guests at yesterday's celebrations, and their friendly welcome and warm sympathy, as she explained how she had come to miss the party, made her send a complacent glance in Piers' direction. What a fuss-box the man was, she thought impatiently, trying to worry her into the belief that her failure to appear at a function on the estate was a major error.",
    "n02-154.png": "And then she received a jolt. Old Hubert, standing beside her, his battered hat in his hand, his toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin, told her in belting tapoto's that n'Mistah Piers' had explained right at the start that n'Mis' Beryl\" would be \"plenty, plenty sad\" not to be heard at the Villa in time.",
    "n02-157.png": "That it wouldn't be her fault at all. That she was a lady who, like her Uncle Charles, took the highest pride in keeping her word. \"I could see Zemuder Stiggins,\" he went on in a lower voice, his sinter black eyes twinkling. \"The powerful anxious I wuz Mistah Pep. We all know how Ballicum bland dangers to all kin of boats, wid deh big rocks in an' out o' de water.",
    "n03-038.png": "He had almost entirely settled back into his old ways, even to reading two about two hours each day, Though he did not refuse wine, which the judge always had on the table at dinner, he did not act as though he found it necessary except in moderate compliance with his father's habits.",
    "n03-064.png": "Around that rounded rocky promontory where the white spray could be seen flying across the distance of a mile and a half, came the yawl under her full triangular sail, and to the judge's frightened eyes, so close to the rocks that it would be dashed against them with the lift of the next wave.",
    "n03-066.png": "\"That boy! That damned fool boy. What does he mean\nby trying to come home now, even if he did promise?\nWhat does time mean when weighed against the life of\ntwo human beings? Not until he was certain that the\nyawl had rounded the rocky point instead of\nbeing flung against the huge boulders did the judge\nempty his lungs of stifling air and refill them\nwith part of that howling northwester gale.\"",
    "n03-079.png": "When the wind was on a rampage, as it was now, it could kick up a sea - sized commotion where it had a straight blow of eight miles down the lake. 3\" Big blow, Judge,\" remarked Willie Kim as the wind billowed out and checked in his baggy black blouse and pantaloons.",
    "n03-082.png": "3\" Blow like hell. Maybe by and by she blow some more. \"Hello, Ollie, where did you come from?\" The judge said in wild surprise. \"I didn't hear you. Do you see that fool boy of mine out there on the lake? I see him. You don't need worry, Judge. Big wind like that can't drown good man.",

He'll wreck!\"\nWillie K\u00fcrn was speechless, only his slant\nblack eyes showing any emotion. With a\nquick shift of tiller, and at the same time\njibbing the boom to wind, he had the\nstay rope fastened, Bill made the\nyarst recover.",
    "n03-103.png": "It seemed to the frightened judge as though his son would actually shoot the craft in under the outer end of the wharf. But by pressing the tiles hard over and at the same time dropping the small sheet of wet canvas, Bill cleared the corners of the piles by inches, and with the tiller still hard over, brought the yawl up against the waves.",
    "n03-106.png": "Willie,\" the judge said huskily, \"that was a pretty a price of seamanship as I ever saw. That dog of mine seems to know how to do everything, when he wants to,\" & Nat,\" disputed his Elli, \"Just play no damns fine luck this time. he plenty smart though.\" As they reached the pier, the judge on his that were a little unsteady, they found Bueno Buck, now on the pier, leading away gawk toward.",

    "n03-120.png": "With four doing the job and the waves pushing at the stern, the yawl was soon dragged out but before it was turned over Bueno Buck reached into the foot of water, tossed out a string of silvery lake trout and said - \"Bill, he's better man at catch 'em than bring, Judge . You look. Little one more as fifteen inches. Maybe big one four feet, huh?\"",
    "n03-126.png": "\"By George, that is a beautiful string of fish!\" exclaimed the judge. \"Toss them on the grass and then we'll all get hold and heave.\" A few moments later the yawl was upside down, exposing its shallow keel.",
    "n04-000.png": "Bertram's face was grim. \"You kind it was the smirk, don't you?\" John gave a short laugh. \"I did,\" he said; \"but I'd better stop thinking that now. Princes is fighting with an identically similar one.\" \"So here you are, my dear.\" Peggy's eyes filled with tears. \"It's so unfair,\" she said.",

Anyway the Parsival affair was far too fresh in both their minds to be a comfortable subject for discussion. \"It\u2019s a command,\" he said. We can do with the extra money. It'll just about pay Jazzy's school fees. \"What shall we do about this house? - and Jill's school? - and oh! how I hate the Navy!",

    "n04-044.png": "John's father had been a naval officer of the old school; some of his rigid ideas had been passed onto the second generation. One of these was that an officer should join a ship, on taking up a new appointment, at nine a.m. precisely, dressed in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword. It would have been acceptable to all concerned if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in plain-clothes on the previous night, but ways instilled by martinet parents have a habit of sticking. \n\nName:",
    "n04-048.png": "So he put up for the night at The Admiral's Head, that famous Portsmouth hostelry, second only in historic interest to The George, unhappily destroyed by German bombs during the last war. Having deposited his luggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he went in search of a drink. The lower bar was empty, save for the lady known by all habitu\u00e9s as 'Seaweed' and a youngish, sharp-eyed man who was sloshing moodily into a gin and tonic.",
    "n04-052.png": "Seaweed's memory was prodigious; his manner must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors of the hotel. She greeted John, however, with less than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning glance at him. Evidently the other occupant of the bar was not persona grata. If her money was good, so was this stranger's.\n\n\"You're Commander Winter,\" she said. \"Have a gin?\" He turned to Seaweed-",
    "n04-060.png": "\"Make it a large one, darlings. I know the naval habits. 'Drink gin and call each other wallah, what!' - as the Guards officer said on his return from a visit to the Royal Navy.

    "n04-068.png": "What are you waiting for, darling? The officer is obviously thirsty. \"John fought back his inherited desire to snub the man. If he did he would have to leave the bar and either sit in the lounge or return to his bedroom.

    "n04-075.png": "\"It's a rule on these premises. No treating with strangers--that's right--John, isn't it?\" \"My fault entirely,\" said the stranger. \"It's my conceited nature--I assumed that you both knew who I was, I'm Jan Hawley. Does that mean anything to you?\" \"Hdiu. Jan Hawley's name was printed at the head of most narial articles in the Daily Courier.\"",
    "n04-084.png": "\"Oh, the Press,\" said Sewued. \"Down here on business, Mr. Bawley?\" \"A pressman is always on the job.\" He held out his hand and John could not do otherwise than take it. \"Pleased to meet you, Commander,\" he said. \"Now what about that drink?\" John nodded - he could afford to buy one in return and he was lonely.",
    "n04-092.png": "\"For the sake of accuracy,\" he said, \"and I know how your newspaper value that commodity! \u2013 please don't address me as Commander. I'm a Lieutenant-Commander. Perhaps we could drop the rank \u2013 such a mouthful!\" \"You're absolutely right,\" said Bawley, as he pushed over his glass, \"Fill it up, darling. Accuracy above all else.

It was his favourite brand,\nhe was on the verge of a new chapter in\nhis career, and his companion's attitude was\nchallenging.",
    "n04-107.png": "Life at home and in Bath had been a trifle too comfortable and humdrum. He'd never before met a pressman and found him curiously stimulating. \"You're a bit of a humorist, aren't you?\" said Bawley, \"The truth is usually very embarra-\nssing. You're in submarines, aren't you?\"\n\"You know a great deal about me,\" said John.",

Other half?\" John nodded. \"On me.\" Bawley shook his head. \"All paid for by His Lordship,\" he said. \"Expense account. You're a married man with a couple of kids. Can't go wasting your substance on a complete stranger. Set 'em up, darling!\"",

Whose portrait appears regularly in the shiny papers?\"",
    "n04-149.png": "\"You mean Murrayard?\" \"Sure. Very useful contact, is our Robbie; he gives us the gen and we give him the publicity. 'The Honourable Robbie' and 'friend', what? You knew that sort of thing.\" \"You'll get nothing out of me,\" said John, \"but you can pay for my drinks if you want to, as long as you keep off Service matters.\"",

Next time you're in Town give me a ring at this number and I'll take you round to the pubs where most of the work is done.\" He held out a card. John took it and put it in his pocket. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"If ever my missus lets me off the chain I'll take you up on that.",
    "n04-171.png": "Ever been out in a submarine? I'll give you a spin round one of these days, if you like, you could write it up.\" Bowley made a face. \"Not in Pericles, old man.\" \"Why not?\"\n\"Better ask Robbie Munyard.\" \"What's he been saying?\" John was furious. The little squirt! To go gassing to a newspaper man!",
    "n04-183.png": "\"Look!\" he went on earnestly. \"You are not going to write up Pericles in some way or other, are you?\" \"What is there to write up?\" said Bardsley. \"There are forty-three submarines in the Navy - why should I pick on Pericles?\" John eyed him steadily. \"It's the Porcupine business, isn't it?\" he said quietly.",

    "n04-195.png": "Mumyard didn't tell me that. But I must confess I'm relieved. But it still doesn't do away with the possibility of faulty design.\" He held out his hand. \"Maybe I will take a trip with you one of these days,\" he said. \"In the meantime I'll tell my editor that the story's a dead bird.",

Don't forget to give me a ring -\nanytime - knock twice and ask for Bawley, what!\"\n\n\"I don't know when that will be,\" said John.\n\n\"I shall be busy for awhile cleaning up after\nMaster bloody Munyard.\" THERE were six submarines,\nlying in pairs alongside the jetty at Ford Blockhouse.\nBlack and grimly businesslike they both looked and\nsounded, for all of them were rumbling as they\ncharged their electric batteries.",
    "n04-209.png": "A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in through the open windows of the Captain's house. It pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over a substantial breakfast. Although usually a very talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's silences for she knew they betokened a worry of some sort.",
    "n04-213.png": "There had been many such breakfasts lately since the affair of Parsifal. Harry had lost a good deal of weight. His normal placid and steady-going manner remained, but she could see that it no longer came naturally. It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine, though in peace time these happenings are few and far between.",
