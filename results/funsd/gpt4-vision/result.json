This will consist of one cell of approximately 175 respondents who are Triumph most often smokers/triers. This study is intended to provide us with any negatives associated with Triumph. Banner points will include Triumph most often smokers (we anticipate approximately 25 most often people), switchers away from Triumph (N approximately 45). It should be noted that an action standard of at least 50% be obtained in each group any product negative association with these groups\u2014see research limitations below for additional action standard.\n\n(See attached memo)\n\nKey Criteria For Analysis\n- Triumph switchers asked why no longer smoking Triumph\n- Present smokers of Triumph asked reasons for switching to Triumph\n- Mentions of \"harshness\"\n\nResearch Limitations\nDue to sample size and experience we feel 25 respondents will presently be Triumph smokers. An action standard of 75% should be utilized for judgments on product negatives only as this is good.\nIf 75% of Triumph smokers mention \"harshness\" we could consider it a problem. If 50-75% of Triumph smokers mention \"harshness\" we could consider it a possible problem (look at other areas).\nIf below 50% of Triumph smokers mention \"harshness\", we could consider it not a problem.\n\nCost Estimate $2,250\n+ 10% Contingency yes \u2610 no \u2612\nFinal Report Inc. yes \u2612 no \u2612\n\nPrepared by: Scott R.
