Schickedantz, Lorillard Accession Number 1662. Reference465-10-1.\n\nSPECIFIC GRAVITY\nNot Determined.\n\nSOLUBILITY\nA221 is soluble in EtOH at 0.2 g/mL, with stirring, at room temperature. Reference BC30-88.\n\nOIL\nA221 forms a solution in corn oil at 0.5 g/0.5 mL, with stirring at room temperature. Reference BC30-88.\n\nACUTE CARDIOVASCULAR\nA221 is insoluble for this procedure. Reference BC30-88.\n\nSTORAGE RECOMMENDATIONS\nRefrigerate in an amber glass bottle at no more than 8\u00b0C.\n\nCOMPOUND SENSITIVE TO\n3 \u2206-P \u2206-T \u2206 MOISTURE 3 OTHER____\n\nSAFETY COMMENTS SUGGESTED HANDLING PROCEDURE\n\nSIGNATURE [signature]\n\nDATE 17/March/89 FORM 0 (9/87)"
